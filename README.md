# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

My name is Michael (he/him), and this is my Github. I live in Philadelphia; I
spent six years or so at [Fastmail](//www.fastmail.com), and I'm starting a
new gig at [MongoDB](//www.mongodb.com) I've written a lot of Perl, and I'll
be writing a lot of Go, but I'm friendly with many backend languages.

Other places you might see me:
- [mcclimon.org](//www.mcclimon.org), my personal website
- [@michael@oldinternet.net](https://oldinternet.net/@michael), on Mastodon
