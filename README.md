# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

My name is Michael (he/him), and this is my Github. I live in Philadelphia; I
work at [MongoDB](//www.mongodb.com), working primarily on
[mongosync](//www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/mongosync).
Before that, I spent six years or so at [Fastmail](//www.fastmail.com), and
before _that_, I was a full-time music theorist. I've been paid in some
capacity to write Go, Perl, Python, Node, and Rust (among others), but I'm
friendly with many programming languages.

Other places you might see me online:
- [mcclimon.org](//www.mcclimon.org), my infrequently updated personal website
- [@michael@oldinternet.net](https://oldinternet.net/@michael), on Mastodon
